    "# What is a Decision Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a support tool with a tree-like structure that models probable outcomes, cost of resources, utilities, and possible consequences. Decision trees provide a way to present algorithms with conditional control statements. They include branches that represent decision-making steps that can lead to a favorable result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are one of the best forms of learning algorithms based on various learning methods. They boost predictive models with accuracy, ease in interpretation, and stability. The tools are also effective in fitting non-linear relationships since they can solve data-fitting challenges, such as regression and classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Categorical variable decision tree\\\n",
    "    A categorical variable decision tree includes categorical target variables that are divided into categories. For example, the categories can be yes or no. The categories mean that every stage of the decision process falls into one category, and there are no in-betweens.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Continuous variable decision tree\\\n",
    "    A continuous variable decision tree is a decision tree with a continuous target variable. For example, the income of an individual whose income is unknown can be predicted based on available information such as their occupation, age, and other continuous variables"
